# A Color API written in bash

This is a sample project that implement the Color API with netcat/make. It
is useful to demonstrate [go-crzy/crzy](https://github.com/go-crzy/crzy). To
test the project,we assume you have all the required dependencies, including
`make`, `curl`, `netca` for OSX, `jq`, `bash 5.1+`  and `nohup` 

To test the project, run:

```bash
make test
```

To run the project, run:

```bash
make start
```

To stop the project, run:

```bash
make stop
```

The artifact is the `color.sh` script
